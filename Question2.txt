Question 2.1 The value under 'rows' column in the output of EXPLAIN query and SELECT query after it are same. What does it mean?

1. Rows column in the output of EXPLAIN tells the number of rows that were examined to produce the output.
2. SELECT count(*) gives us the count of all the rows of the comments table.  
3. Since both gives us the same output, it means that MySQL examined all the rows to produce the output, therefore it may not be the optimal query.


Question 2.2 Is the SELECT query optimal? If no, how do we optimize it?

No this query is not the optimal query. As per the output of the explain query, key column is null. This means that user_id is not indexed, 
therefore we can optimize the query by adding the indexing to user_id column.
